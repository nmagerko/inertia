INERTIA
=======

Inertia is a physics simulator (albeit, a simple one), built by Nick Magerko and Jon Reynolds at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA). 

Focusing on one of the countless technical applications of computer science, we have developed a year-long course in which we will apply our growing knowledge of both physics and computing to allow for the visualization of a variety of physical phenomena. Most often, we will dedicate our resources to visualizing aspects of a single physical sub-field: classical mechanics. Nonetheless, we aspire to work our way into electricity and magnetism as well (time-permitting).
